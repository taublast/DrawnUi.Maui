To replace native controls with with just one native view - the Canvas! 🤩 On **iOS**, **MacCatalyst**, **Android**, **Windows** with hardware acceleration.

Rendering engine with an enhanced layout system, gestures and animations powered by [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp).   

* To use inside a usual MAUI app, consume drawn controls by wrapping inside `Canvas` views.
* To create a totally drawn app with just one `Canvas` as root view, use `SkiaShell` + `SkiaViewSwitcher` for navigation between screens with modals, popups, toasts etc.
* Drawn controls are totally virtual, no native views/handlers.
* Design in XAML or [code-behind](Fluent.md)
* Free to use under the MIT license, a nuget package is available.

Current development state is _ALPHA for prod_.

## Features

* __Draws using SkiaSharp with hardware acceleration__
* __Create your own animated pixel-perfect controls__
* __Port existing native controls to be drawn__
* __Design in XAML or code-behind__
* __2D and 3D Transforms__
* __Visual effects__ for every control, filters and shaders
* __Animations__ targeting max FPS
* __Caching system__ for faster re-drawing
* __Optimized for performance__, rendering only visible elements, recycling templates etc
* __Gestures__ support for anything, panning, scrolling, zooming etc
* __Keyboard support__, track any key
* __Navigate__ on canvas with familiar MAUI Shell techniques 

## What's new

* The nuget package `DrawnUi.Maui` replaces the old package Id, you can still use the old one kept for compatibility for some time.
* Docs, first appearence inside `/docs`! To teach LMs use `/aidocs` subfolder.
* `SkiaCamera` inside DrawnUi.Maui.Camera: iOS, MacCatalyst, Windows, Android implementations.
* `SkiaShape` now can contain many `Children` instead of one `Content`, can change layout type with `Layout` property. Plus fixes for stroke and other for pixel-perfect rendering.
* Stack and absolute layouts now correctly apply one-directional `Fill` of children, might break some legacy UIs (or might not). `Margins` and `Padding` now work properly everywhere.
* Can override virtual `OnMeasuring`, while `Measure` is not virtual anymore to assure faster screen creation and avoid re-measurements when initializing for the first time.
* Important performance optimizations and fixes for layouts and SkiaLabel.
* Performance and safety optimizations for accelerated rendering handlers (`SkiaViewAccelerated:SKGLView`) on all platforms.
* Windows accelerated handler is now synched with display when its refresh rate is >=120.
* Frame time interpolator adjustments for DrawnUi.Maui.Game.
* Many other silent fixes and new properties/features.
* Example apps updated to align with changes.

 ## Development Notes

 * .NET 9 only, Maui.Controls 9.0.70 minimum.
* All files to be consumed (images etc) must be placed inside the MAUI app Resources/Raw folder, subfolders allowed. If you need to load from the native app folder use prefix "file://".
* By default the main branch should be targeting NET 9 and use SkiaSharp v3.
 * To be able to use hardware accelerated Windows canvas with NET 9 you need to [pack your Windows project as MSIX](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/windows/setup?view=net-maui-9.0). In visua studio this might create a situation (until it's fixed) when you need to hit Build every time you change your code and only then hit Run, otherwise VS will run the previous package.
* The `<UseSkiaSharp3>true</UseSkiaSharp3>` inside `Directory.Build.props` file controls where we build for v3 net9 or v2 net8. 
* Accessibility support is compatible and is on the roadmap.

## Installation

Install the package __AppoMobi.Maui.DrawnUi__ from NuGet, please install stable versions only.  
For NET 9 you need versions not lower than 1.3.x. For legacy NET 8 and SkiaSharp v2 versions use 1.2.x. but they are not updated any more, we stick with .NET 9, looking at upcoming .NET 10.

You might also need at least the following MAUI setup inside your csproj:

```
	<PropertyGroup>
        <WindowsPackageType>MSIX</WindowsPackageType>
		<SupportedOSPlatformVersion Condition="$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)')) == 'ios'">15.0</SupportedOSPlatformVersion>
		<SupportedOSPlatformVersion Condition="$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)')) == 'maccatalyst'">15.2</SupportedOSPlatformVersion>
		<SupportedOSPlatformVersion Condition="$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)')) == 'android'">21.0</SupportedOSPlatformVersion>
        <SupportedOSPlatformVersion Condition="$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)')) == 'windows'">10.0.19041.0</SupportedOSPlatformVersion>
        <TargetPlatformMinVersion Condition="$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)')) == 'windows'">10.0.19041.0</TargetPlatformMinVersion>
	</PropertyGroup>
    
    <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Maui.Controls" Version="9.0.70" />
        <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Compatibility" Version="9.0.70" />
    </ItemGroup>

```

After that initialize the library inside your MauiProgram.cs file:

```csharp
builder.UseDrawnUi();
```

## ___Docs are under construction, already working on!___

## Quick Start

You will be mainly using Maui view `Canvas` that will wrap your SkiaControls.
Anywhere in your existing Maui app you can include a `Canvas` and start drawing your UI.
The `Canvas` control is aware of its children's size and will resize accordingly.
At the same time, you could set a fixed size for the `Canvas` and its children will adapt to it.

#### Xaml
Import the namespace:
```xml  
  xmlns:draw="http://schemas.appomobi.com/drawnUi/2023/draw"
```
Consume:

```xml  
<draw:Canvas>
     <draw:SkiaSvg
        Source="Svg/dotnet_bot.svg"
        LockRatio="1"
        TintColor="White"
        WidthRequest="44" />
</draw:Canvas>
```

As you can see in this example the Maui view `Canvas` will adapt its size to drawn content and should take 44x44 pts. `LockRatio="1"` tells the engine to take the highest calculated dimension and multiply it by 1, so even if we omitted `HeightRequest` it was set to 44.

#### Code behind

Can use basic [FluentExtensions](https://github.com/taublast/DrawnUi/blob/main/src/Engine/Internals/Extensions/FluentExtensions.cs) will be adding more

```csharp
            Canvas = new Canvas()
            {
                Gestures = GesturesMode.Enabled,
                RenderingMode = RenderingModeType.Accelerated,
                HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Fill,
                VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Fill,
                BackgroundColor = Colors.Black,
                Content = new SkiaLayout()
                {
                    HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Fill,
                    VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Fill,
                    Children = new List<SkiaControl>()
                    {

                        new SkiaShape()
                            {
                                BackgroundColor = Colors.DodgerBlue,
                                CornerRadius = 16,
                                WidthRequest = 150,
                                HeightRequest = 150,
                                HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
                                VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
                                Content = new SkiaLabel()
                                {
                                    TextColor = Colors.White,
                                    HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
                                    VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center,
                                    Text="Oyee"
                                }
                            }
                    }
                }
            };
```

Please check the Sandbox and Demo apps, they contain many examples of usage.

#### Important differences between DrawnUI and Xamarin.Forms/Maui layouts:

* `HorizontalOptions` and `VerticalOptions` defaults are not `Fill` but `Start`. Request size explicitly or set some options to `Fill`, otherwise your control will take zero space.
* `Grid` layout type default Row- and ColumnSpacing are not 8 but 1.

### MAUI Controls Replication

#### Draw a line or reserve space

Use a simple `SkiaControl` with height and background color set. For complex shapes use `SkiaShape` or `SkiaPath`.

#### Simulate MAUI Grid

`SkiaLayout` of `Grid` type, set children properties as usual (`Grid.`something)

#### Simulate MAUI StackLayout inside a ScrollView

`SkiaScroll` + `SkiaLayout` of type `Column`/`Row`. Its up to you to decide whether to cache the layout or its children only. It's best not to cache the layout for large stacks and the virtualisation will enter the game.

#### Simulate MAUI CollectionView

`SkiaScroll` + `SkiaLayout` of type `Column`/`Row` (`ItemTemplate`=...). Set cache of the cell to `ImageDoubleBuffered` or other appropriate. 
You might also what to order to create `ItemTemplate` in background not to freeze the UI by using `InitializeTemplatesInBackgroundDelay` property.
An important property here is `VirtualisationInflated` how mocj of the content outside the visible bounds should still be rendered, better not be 0 to have 
more recycled cells in use and make scroll more smooth.
*IMPORTANT:* Remember default layout properties are `Start` and not `Fill` like in standart MAUI.

#### Simulate MAUI StackLayout with a BidableLayout.ItemTemplate 

`SkiaScroll` with `Virtualisation`=`Disabled` + `SkiaLayout` of type `Column`/`Row` (`ItemTemplate`=...) do not forget to cache your cell template. 

## MAUI Compatibility Limitations

* Binding RelativeSource with FindAncestorBindingContext not working yet.


## Images

* Images loaded and converted for skia format are cached on a per-app run basis.

* When an image fails to load then if the app was offline the image will get its method `ReloadSource` invoked. So when you go online your missing images will get automatically loaded!

* 'SkiaScroll' can also control the loading of images via `VelocityImageLoaderLock` property, that would lock and unlock loading of images globally in case of a huge velocity scroll.

Base control for using images is `SkiaImage` with many virtuals to be easily subclassed for your needs. The `Source` property is a usual maui `ImageSource`.
`SkiaImageManager` loads platform sources and converts them to skia format. It falls back to default MAUI methods for loading `ImageSource` in some cases.

On Android the `Glide` library is used for loading urls. It caches images, making it so that if the app is offline it still gets its images from cache if they were loaded previously.

### Gestures

To make your root `Canvas` catch gestures you need to attach a `TouchEffect` to it. This can be done automatically by setting `GesturesEnabled="True"` for the `Canvas`.
After that skia controls can process gestures in multiple ways:
* At low level by implementing an `ISkiaGestureListener` interface and overriding `OnGestureReceived`.
* At control level by overriding `ProcessGestures`, recommended for custom controls.
* Attaching an `AddGestures` effect that has properties similar to `SkiaHotspot`.
* Including a `SkiaHotspot` as a child.
* Using a `SkiaButton`.

Parent controls have full control over gestures and passing them to children. 
In a base scenario, a gesture would be passed all along to the ends of a view tree to its ends for every top-level control.
If a gesture is marked as consumed (by returning the reference of the consumer, not consumed if `null`) a control would typically stop processing gestures at its level. 

By overriding `ProcessGestures` any control might process gestures with or without passing them to children.

When creating a custom control the standard code for the override would be to pass gestures below by calling `base` then processing at the current level. You might choose to do it differently according to your needs.

The engine is designed to pass the ending gestures to those who already returned "consumed" for preceding gestures even if the following gestures are out of their hitbox.

__More docs will be added on this matter.__


### Caching System

_!_ Without caching animations going beyond simple wouldn't be possible. 
Caching makes complicated processing needed just once for layout calculation 
and then the caching result is redrawn on every frame.

Caching is controlled using a property `UseCache` of the following type:

```csharp
public enum SkiaCacheType
{
    /// <summary>
    /// True and old school
    /// </summary>
    None,

    /// <summary>
    /// Create and reuse SKPicture. Try this first for labels, svg etc. 
    /// Do not use this when dropping shadows or with other effects, better use Bitmap. 
    /// </summary>
    Operations,

    /// <summary>
    /// Will use simple SKBitmap cache type, will not use hardware acceleration.
    /// Slower but will work for sizes bigger than graphics memory if needed.
    /// </summary>
    Image,

    /// <summary>
    /// Using `Image` cache type with double buffering. Best for fast animated scenarios, this must be implemented by a specific control, not all controls support this, will fallback to 'Image' if anything.
    /// </summary>
    ImageDoubleBuffered,

    /// <summary>
    /// The way to go when dealing with images surrounded by shapes etc.
    /// The cached surface will use the same graphic context as your canvas.
    /// If hardware acceleration is enabled will try to cache as Bitmap inside graphics memory. Will fallback to simple Bitmap cache type if not possible. If you experience issues using it, switch to Memory cache type.
    /// </summary>
    GPU,
}

```

You should tweak your design caching to avoid unnecessary re-drawing of elements. 
The basic approach here is to cache small elements at some level. 
When you start using any kind of animations you should start using caching to max your FPS. You can check the __DemoApp__ for such examples.

#### Caching Tips:

* Cache shapes, svg and text as `Operations`.
* Prefer caching shadows and gradients as `Image` instead of `Operations`.
* Cache large static overlays as `GPU`, large static blocks as `Image`.
* For dynamically changing controls consider `ImageDoubleBuffered`, it consumes double the memory as `Image` but doesn't slow down rendering: you would see the latest prepared cache until the actual state wouldn't finish rendering itsself to a hidden cache layer in background.
* Do not include controls cached with `GPU` inside controls that use different type of cache, except for `Disabled`, will get a native crash otherwise.

#### Loaded Images

We are using the __EasyCaching.InMemory__ library for caching loaded bitmaps. Its impact can much be seen when using recycled cells inside a scroll. 
_todo add options and link to ImageLoader and SkiaImage docs_

_!_ When using images inside dynamic scenes, like a templated stack with scroll or other 
you should try to set the image cache to `Image` this would most probably climb your fps.
This is due to the fact that image sources are usually of the wrong size and they need processing 
before being drawn. When using `Image` cache the image would be processed only once and 
then just redrawn.

### Animations

One would create animations and effects using animators. Animators are attached to controls, but technically register themselves at the root canvas level and their code is executed on every rendering frame. If the canvas is not redrawing then animators will not be executed.
When the canvas has a registered animator running it would constantly force re-drawing itself until all animators are stopped.

There are two types of animators: 
* __Animators__ are executed before the drawing, so you can move and transform elements before the are rendered on the canvas.
* __PostAnimators__ are executed after their parent element was drawn, so you can paint an effect over the existing result, or execute any other post-drawing logic.

### Layout

For initial items positioning you would be using `SkiaLayout`. 
Its `Absolute` layout type is already built-in inside every skia control..

You can position your children using familiar properties like
`HorizonalOptions`, `VerticalOptions`, `Margin`, parent `Padding`,
`WidthRequest`, `HeightRequest`,`MinimumWidthRequest`, `MinimumHeightRequest` 
and additional `MaximumWidthRequest`,  `MaximumHeightRequest`, `HorizontalFillRatio`, `VerticalFillRatio` and `LockRatio` properties.

* `LockRatio` will be used to calculate the width when the height is set or vice versa. If it's above 0 the max value will be applied, if it's below 0 the min value will be applied. If it's 0 then the ratio will be ignored.
* `HorizontalFillRatio`, `VerticalFillRatio` will let you take a percent and the available size if you don't set a numeric request.  
    For example if `HorizontalFillRatio` is set to 0.5 you will take 50% of the available width, at the same time being able to align the control at start, center or at the and in a usual way.
* `HorizontalPositionOffsetRatio` and `VerticalPositionOffsetRatio` let you offset the item after it was aligned by applying a ratio to its computed size. Defaults are 0.0.  
    For example, HorizontalPositionOffsetRatio of -0.5 will offset the item by -Width/2, practically centering it horizontally along the current x-position. Works almost like translation but relatively to the current size.

For dynamic positioning or other precise cases use `TranslationX` and `TranslationY`.

When you need to layout children in a more arranged way you will want to wrap them with a `SkiaLayout`
of different `LayoutType` : `Grid`, `Colum`, `Row` and others.

Layout supports `ItemTemplate` for most of layout types.

For grid, we have so useful feats like, instead of using `RowDefinitions="32,32,32,32"` you can just do i nice `DefaultRowDefinition="32"`.

Some differences from Xamarin.Forms/Maui to notice:

* Layouts as other controls come with `HorizontalOptions` and `VerticalOptions` as `Start` and not `Fill` by default, so if your children do not request a size explicitly, 
the parent layout will not take any space at all unless you ask it to `Fill` the desired dimension, for example a `Column` needs its  `HorizontalOptions` to be `Fill` or specified explicitly.

* Actually for performance reasons in `Column` and `Row` layouts children cannot have `Fill`, `End` and `Center` in the direction of the layout, only `Start`. For example, if you have a `Column` children must have `VerticalOptions` set to `Start`. When you still need these options for children please use `Absolute` or `Grid` layouts.

_!_ Layouts `Column` and `Row`, whether templated or not, 
will always check if child is out of the visible screen bounds and avoid rendering it in that case.
That is especially useful when the layout is inside a `SkiaScroll`, this way we always render 
only the visible part. You can tweak this but setting a `SkiaLayout` property `VirtualisationInflated` in points, how many of the hidden amount outside the visible bounds should still be rendered. 
This system ensures that you can have an infinite-size layout inside a scroll and it will work just fine drawing only the visible area.
At the same time if you want a `SkiaScroll` to <s>lye</s> communicate to its content that everything is visible on the screen you can set its `VirtualizationEnabled="False"`.

_!_ You can absolutely use the `Margin` property in a usual Maui way. In case if you would need to bind a specific margin you can switch to 
using `MarginLeft`, `MarginTop`, `MarginRight`, `MarginBottom` properties, -1.0 by default, 
if set they will override the specific value from `Margin`, and the result would be accessible via `Margins` read-only bindable static property.  
Even more, sometimes you might want to bind your code to `AddMarginTop`, `AddMarginLeft`, `AddMarginRight`, `AddMarginBottom`..  
When designing custom controls please use `Margins` property to read the final margin value.

##### BindingContext propagation in layout

When a parent has children attached it sets their binding content to its own by calling `SetInheritedBindingContext` of the child ONLY if child's BindingContext is actually null. So when the Parent property of the child gets set to null this child BindingContext is set to null too.   

Any `SkiaControl` implements `public virtual void SetInheritedBindingContext(object context)` that you can override to prohibit changing binding context or apply any other logic.

Another case is when the control `BindingContext` changes for any reason, `public virtual void ApplyBindingContext()` method is invoked. Layouts override it to implement an additional logic to modify or not its children `BindingContext`. Some view containers use the following logic:

```csharp
public override void ApplyBindingContext()
        {
            base.ApplyBindingContext();

			//preserve child context
            if (Content?.BindingContext == null)
                Content?.SetInheritedBindingContext(BindingContext);
        }
```

#### Loading sources

SkiaImage, SkiaLottie and other controls that have a `Source` property, can load data from web, from bundled resources and from native file system.
The conventions are the following:
- if a web url is detected the source is loaded from web
- if a file path starts with file:// it will be loaded from native file system
- otherwise will try to load from bundled resources with root folder 'Resources\Raw'. 

The example below will load animation from `Resources\Raw\Lottie\Loader.json`.

```xml  
            <draw:SkiaLottie
                InputTransparent="True"
                AutoPlay="True"
                ColorTint="{StaticResource ColorPrimary}"
                HorizontalOptions="Center"
                ="1"
                Opacity="0.85"
                Repeat="-1"
                Source="Lottie/Loader.json"
                Tag="Loader"
                VerticalOptions="Center"
                WidthRequest="56" />
```

#### Control Children

You have a main property `Children` as a main interface to set your subviews at initialization. 
There are some layout controls that use `Content` property instead of `Children` as they accept only one child. 
MAUI XAML engine will place controls inside those properties too.  
When initializing control from XAML, what you place inside your layout control will land inside `Children`.  
When initializing from code-behind you can set `Children` directly:

```csharp
	new SkiaLayout()
	{
		Type = LayoutType.Column,
		HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Fill,
		Children = new List<SkiaControl>()
		{
			new SkiaLabel()
			{
				TextColor = Colors.Yellow,
				Text = "Hello",
			},
			new SkiaLabel()
			{
				TextColor = Colors.Red,
				Text = "Word",
			}
		}
	},
```

If you wish to create controls or customize them, let's take an example of how `SkiaLayout` works.  
The `Children` property is set at startup. A this is a thread-unsafe property (the upper framework might changing on UI-thread) we insert sub-controls into the `Views` internal property.  
As `SkiaLayout` can be templated it uses a views adapter. This one iterates either `Views`, either virtual views created from the provided template.  
As You can see `Children` is used mainly for initialization only and a control might have it's own subviews processing logic. It may choose to use or completely ignore what is placed inside `Children`.  

If we talk about a non-templated layout at runtime we can manage subviews with: `AddSubView`, `RemoveSubView` and `ClearChildren` methods.  
Those will correctly apply all the needed logic regarding, BindingContext, HotReload, disposal of subviews etc. 
Expect virtuals `OnChildAdded(SkiaControl child)` and `OnChildRemoved(SkiaControl child)` to be invoked.


## Maui Views

### `Canvas`

#### _Events_:

__`WillDraw`__ 

__`WillFirstTimeDraw`__ 

__`WasDrawn`__ 

#### _Methods_: 

__`TakeScreenShot(Action<SKImage> callback)`__ Takes screenshot on next draw. Passes an `SKImage`, can be null. If you need an `SKBitmap` use `SKBitmap.FromImage` on it.

#### _Properties_:

__`Surface`__ 


### `SkiaShell`

The usage is almost the same as the standard Maui Shell, 
with some extra features.

`SkiaShell` is derived from `FastShell` that uses Maui interfaces 
and implements methods for standard maui navigation, 
then adds features to be able to navigate inside the Canvas.

Some additional features to be mentioned are actions that can be executed for specific routes.
code example:

```csharp  
RegisterRoute("profile", typeof(ScreenUserProfile));

RegisterActionRoute("settings", () =>
{
    //select settings tab
    this.NavigationLayout.SelectedIndex = 4;
});

```

#### Usage

Please see the demo.

## Drawn Controls

### `SkiaControl`

Base drawn element, derived from Maui `Element` to assure basic Maui Xaml compatibility, could derive from a `BindableObject` if Maui would provide public interfaces for that matter.

#### _Properties_:

__`LockRatio`__ a numeric value that will be used to calculate the width when the height is set or vice versa. If it's above 0 the max value will be applied, if it's below 0 the min value will be applied. If it's 0 then the ratio will be ignored.

Example 1:
```xml  
  <draw:SkiaShape
                        LockRatio="1"
                        WidthRequest="40" />
```
HeightRequest wasn't specified but this control will request 40 by 40 pts.

Example 2:
```xml  
  <draw:SkiaShape
	LockRatio="-1"
	HeightRequest="30"
	WidthRequest="40" />
```
This control will request 30 by 30 pts.

__`VisualEffects`__ a list of effects you can attach to affect to change how your controls is drawing. 
It's easy to create effects for dirrerent tasks, would it be making your control black and white or animate it with conditions.
Actually you can attach different types of effects to every control:
* One effect changing the color filter, impements `IColorEffect`.
* One effect changing the image filter, impements `IImageEffect`.
* Any number of effects affecting the rendering before the controls drawing is finalized and eventually saved to cache, implementing `IRenderEffect`, applied in chain.
* Any number of effects implementing `IStateEffect`, thoses can be used to change your control state, animate etc.
* One post renderer, impements `IPostRendererEffect`, this one will render the cache in its own way, if you'd want to apply a shader etc.
* Any effect can implement `ISkiaGestureProcessor`, to become gestures-aware.  

### `SkiaScroll`

`SkiaScroll` is a scrollable container that supports virtualization and recycling of its children.

If you include a `SkiaLayout` inside a `SkiaScroll` only visible on screen items will be rendered.

If the include a `SkiaLayout` that uses `ItemTemplate` this combination will automatically become virtualized and you will get sort of a CollectionView with recycled cells at your disposal. It is a good practice to use it for long lists of items.

#### _Properties_:

__`Orientation`__ a value of type `ScrollOrientation` that can be `Vertical` or `Horizontal`.

__`FrictionScrolled`__  Use this to control how fast the scroll will decelerate. Values 0.1f - 0.3f are the best, default is 0.1f.

__`IgnoreWrongDirection`__  Will ignore gestures of the wrong direction, for example, if this Orientation is Horizontal will ignore gestures with vertical direction velocity. Might want to set it to true when you have a horizontal scroll inside a vertical scroll, this will let the parent scroll start scrolling vertically even if the gesture started inside its horizontal scroll child.

### `SkiaLayout`

`SkiaLayout` is a container that supports various layout types: `Absolute`, `Grid`, `Row`, `Column`, and others. 

It also supports virtualization and recycling of its children with `ItemTemplate` property.

Controls inside templated `SkiaLayout` can implement `ISkiaCell` interface to eventually receive information about their state:
* `OnAppearing`
* `OnDisapearing`
* `OnScrolled`

This lets one to create custom controls that can react to scrolling and other events with animations etc.

### `SkiaShape`

`SkiaShape` is a base class for all shapes. You could fill it, stroke, drop shadows, apply gradients, and even clip other controls with it.

### `SkiaImage`

`SkiaImage` is a control that renders images. It can't apply filters and transformations.



### `SkiaSvg`

`SkiaSvg` is a control that renders svg files. It can't tint the svg with a color or gradient, and apply some transforms to it.

You can set the svg as string via `SvgString` property, or same is by including the string data as XAML content:

```xml
    <draw:SkiaSvg
        HeightRequest="110"
        HorizontalOptions="Center"
        LockRatio="1"
        Opacity="0.5"
        TintColor="{StaticResource Gray950}"
        UseCache="Operations"
        VerticalOptions="Center"
        ZIndex="-1">
        <![CDATA[                                      
        <svg width="20" height="18" viewBox="0 0 20 18" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
        <path d="M15 0H5C2.243 0 0 2.243 0 5V13C0 15.757 2.243 18 5 18H15C17.757 18 20 15.757 20 13V5C20 2.243 17.757 0 15 0ZM5 2H15C16.654 2 18 3.346 18 5V9.58594L14.417 6.00293C13.636 5.22193 12.364 5.22193 11.583 6.00293L7 10.5859L6.41701 10.0029C5.63601 9.22193 4.36399 9.22193 3.58299 10.0029L2 11.5859V5C2 3.346 3.346 2 5 2ZM4.5 6C4.5 5.172 5.172 4.5 6 4.5C6.828 4.5 7.5 5.172 7.5 6C7.5 6.828 6.828 7.5 6 7.5C5.172 7.5 4.5 6.828 4.5 6Z" fill="#41416E"/>
        </svg>
        ]]>
    </draw:SkiaSvg>
```
or just set the property directly, code-behind example:

```csharp
var control = new SkiaSvg()
{
    SvgString = "<svg... whatever..></svg>"
}
```

Other properties of interest may be: `Zoom`, `ZoomX`, `Zoomy`, `VerticalOffset`, `HorizontalOffset`, `HorizontalAlignment` and more..

You can also apply a gradient to your svg, either like to any control with a VisualEffect (see VisualEffects) or by using following properties to apply a linear gradient:

UseGradient, StartXRatio, EndXRatio, StartYRatio, EndYRatio, StartColor, EndColor, GradientBlendMode


### `SkiaLabel`

A multi-line label fighting for his place under the sun.

#### _Properties_:

__`FontWeight`__ a numeric value used in case you have properly registered your fonts to support weights. 
You can use your font the usual Maui way but in the case of custom font files used from resources you might want to register them, using the following example:
```csharp
.ConfigureFonts(fonts =>
{
   fonts.AddFont("Gilroy-Regular.ttf", "FontText", FontWeight.Regular);
   fonts.AddFont("Gilroy-Medium.ttf", "FontText", FontWeight.Medium);
});
```
Now if you set the `FontWeight` to `500` the control will use the `Gilroy-Medium.ttf` file.
This might come in very handy when your Figma design shows you to use this weight and you want just to pass it over to SkiaLabel.

 __`HorizontalTextAlignment`__  : 
 ```csharp
public enum DrawTextAlignment
{
	Start,
	Center,
	End,
	FillWords,
	FillWordsFull,
	FillCharacters,
	FillCharactersFull,
}
```


### `SkiaLottie`

`SkiaLottie` is a control that renders Lottie files. 
It can even tint some colors inside your animation!   
You could fast-tint one color with `ColorTint` property. But if you find yourself in need to tint many colors use `Colors`,
for example if we wanted to tint 2 distincts colors inside:

```xaml
 <draw:SkiaLottie
    AutoPlay="True"
    HorizontalOptions="Center"
    WidthRequest="50"
    LockRatio="1"
    Repeat="-1"
    Source="Lottie/Loader.json"
    VerticalOptions="Center"                        >
    <draw:SkiaLottie.Colors>
        <Color>#FF0000</Color>
        <Color>#FFFFFF</Color>
    </draw:SkiaLottie.Colors>
</draw:SkiaLottie>
```

### `SkiaRive`

Actually for Windows only, this plays and controls Rive animation files. Other platforms will be added soon, poke if you would like to help binding some c++;

### SkiaHoverMask

A control deriving from SkiaShape that can be used to create hover effects. 
It will render a mask over its children when hovered, think of it as an inverted shape.

## Since You Are Still Here

[A small article](https://taublast.github.io/posts/MauiJuly/) about the library and why it was created

## Old School

* A Light [version for Xamarin](https://github.com/taublast/DrawnUi.Xamarin) is there too.

## Latest Update

* To avoid existing confusion `ViewsAdapter` props renamed:
`GetViewForIndex` to `GetExistingViewAtIndex`,
`GetViewAtIndex` to `GetOrCreateViewForIndex`

* A lot of fluent C# extensions to be used for constructing UI without XAML, without using MAUI bindings still being able to mimic one-way and two-way bindings, examples incoming.
* Retained custom handlers for all platforms, `Canvas` property `RenderingMode` replaced `HardwareAcceleration`.
* Selectable default look for controls: SkiaButton, SkiaSwitch, SkiaCheckbox, more to come. Example: `  <draw:SkiaButton ControlStyle="Cupertino" Text="Button" />`, check out Sandbox project.
* Performance: `ImageComposite` cache now works inside another `ImageComposite`.
* SkiaLayout received gestures events for easier use without subclassing. `ChildTapped`, `Tapped`. SkiaShape now has them too.
* Gestures tuned to avoid false-taps when swiping.
* Many fixes and new features here and there.
